<h1>Right to Speak</h1>

<h3>Right to Speak is an open-source Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) app, written in React Native for iOS and Android. It is based on the principles of motor planning and communicative utterance.</h3>


Imagine waking up without the ability to communicate. No voice, no body language, nothing. How would you hang out with your friends? Order food? Tell your family you love them?

There are people here in Austin and around the country who, from birth or after, can’t use their voice to speak. Whether it is congenital birth defects, cerebral palsy, autism, ALS, or any number of diagnosed disabilities, they’ve lost the ability to communicate the way most of us can.

That doesn’t mean they don’t have something to say. With technology, we can help them communicate their choices, thoughts, emotions and more. Stephen Hawking is a great example of an augmentative communication user.

Unfortunately, there is a vast discrepancy of access to this technology. As a speech pathologist, I see that if you don’t have money, it is much more difficult to get access to this life-changing technology.

My project hopes to bridge this access gap by creating a cross-platform app that is free and based on the latest, evidence-based interventions for augmentative communication users.

I’m looking for volunteers with knowledge of React Native and React, JavaScript, Flexbox, design, and more.

I’m Daniel Rigney and I believe everyone has the right to speak.
