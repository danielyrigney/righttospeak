# Right to Speak

Imagine waking up without the ability to communicate. No voice, body language, gestures, or text. How would you hang out with your friends? Order food? Tell your family you love them?

Every day, there are over two million people in the United States who lack traditional means of communication due to congenital birth defects, cerebral palsy, autism, ALS, and other disabilities. 

With the assistance of technology, we can help those affected to communicate their choices, thoughts, and emotions. Unfortunately, cost is a large barrier to this technology. Speech-Language Pathologist, Daniel Rigney, aims to bridge this gap by creating a cross-platform app that is accessible to all.

## What is Right to Speak?
