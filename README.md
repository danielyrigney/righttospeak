<h1>The Right to Speak</h1>

<h6>RTS is open-source Alternative and Augmentative Communication App written in React Native to be used for iOS and Android. It is based on the principles of motor planning and making the function of the communicative utterance </h6>


Imagine waking up without the ability to communicate. No voice, no body language or gestures,
nothing. How would you hang out with your friends? Order food? Tell your family you love them?

There are people here in Austin and around the country who because of the way they were born can’t
or don’t use their voice to speak. Whether it is congenital birth defects, cerebral palsy, autism, ALS, or
any number of diagnosed disabilities, they’ve lost the ability to communicate the way most of us do.
But that doesn’t mean they don’t have something to say.
Using technologies we are able augment their communication such that they can communicate their
choices, thoughts, emotions and more. Stephen Hawking is a great example of an augmentative
communication user.
But there is a vast discrepancy of access to this technology. As a speech pathologist I work with this
population every day and see that if you don’t have money it is much more difficult to get access to this
technology.
My project hopes to bridge this access gap by creating a cross platform app that is free and based on the
latest evidence-based interventions for augmentative communication users.
I’m looking for volunteers with knowledge of React Native and React, javascript, flexbox, design, and
more.
I’m Daniel Rigney and I believe everyone has the right to speak.
